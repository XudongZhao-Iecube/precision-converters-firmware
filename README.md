[Analog Devices Inc.](http://www.analog.com/en/index.html) Precision Converters Firmware Applications

## About
This repository contains the embedded firmware applications for Analog Devices Precision Converters. The applications are targetted for primaraly Mbed and STM32 platforms, 
however they can be easily retargetted to other platforms as well. 
The firmware application are developed to interface with Precision Converters (ADCs/DACs) in order to configure/access device parameters and capture device data over serial 
communication link.
